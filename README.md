FROGGER
===============================

This is my version of the classic arcade game Frogger.


Playing the Game
===============================

To play the game go to the following page:

http://firzhugh.github.io/frogger/

Or you can clone it to your PC and run it by opening the file index.html. The game requires jQuery and Bootstrap to run but both of these are included in js and css folders of this repository.


Game Play
===============================

To move the player:

* left arrow key moves the player one square to the left
* right arrow key moves the player one square to the right
* up arrow key moves the player one square up
* down arrow key moves the player one square down


Aim of the game is to collect jewels for points and get the key to proceed through one of the gates at the top. Collect as many points as you can.

The player initially has 3 lives. Lives are lost when the player gets caught by a bug or when he walks into the water at the top of the screen.

I hope you enjoy the game!
